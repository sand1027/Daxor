            Software development encompasses the processes involved in creating,
            designing, deploying, and maintaining software applications,
            systems, or platforms. It involves various stages, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Planning and Requirement Analysis: Understanding the needs of the
              stakeholders, defining project goals, and determining the scope of
              the software.
            </li>
            <li>
              Design: Creating the architectural design of the software,
              including its structure, user interface, and system components.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementation/Coding: Writing the actual code according to the
              design specifications. This involves using programming languages,
              frameworks, and libraries.
            </li>
            <li>
              Testing: Verifying that the software functions correctly and meets
              the requirements through various testing methodologies like unit
              testing, integration testing, and system testing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deployment: Releasing the software for use, which can involve
              installing it on servers, distributing it to users, or deploying
              it on cloud platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates to
              ensure the software's continued functionality and meets evolving
              requirements.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

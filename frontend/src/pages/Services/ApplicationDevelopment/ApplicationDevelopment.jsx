            <li>
              Requirement Gathering and Analysis : Understand the needs and
              objectives of the web application by gathering requirements from
              stakeholders. This involves discussions, interviews, and
              documentation to clarify features, functionality, and user
              expectations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Architecture and Design : Create the architectural design and user
              interface design for the web application based on the gathered
              requirements. This includes defining the structure, layout,
              navigation, and interactions within the application.
            </li>
            <li>
              Front-end Development : Develop the client-side components of the
              web application using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript. This involves implementing the user interface design
              and ensuring responsiveness and usability across different devices
              and browsers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Back-end Development : Develop the server-side components of the
              web application, including the application logic, database
              interactions, and server-side scripting. This often involves using
              server-side programming languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or
              Node.js, as well as frameworks such as Django, Ruby on Rails,
              Spring Boot, or Express.js.
            </li>
            <li>
              Database Design and Implementation : Design the database schema
              and implement the database to store and retrieve data for the web
              application. This may involve using relational databases like
              MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, or NoSQL databases like MongoDB
              or Firebase.
            </li>
            <li>
              Testing : Test the web application to ensure that it functions
              correctly and meets the specified requirements. This includes
              various types of testing such as unit testing, integration
              testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deployment : Deploy the web application to a web server or cloud
              platform for public access. This may involve setting up
              infrastructure, configuring environments, and ensuring security
              and scalability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintenance and Support : Provide ongoing maintenance and support
              for the web application after deployment. This includes addressing
              bug fixes, implementing updates, and incorporating user feedback
              to improve performance, usability, and security.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Throughout the development process, collaboration among team
            members, including developers, designers, testers, and stakeholders,
            is crucial. Project management methodologies like Agile or Scrum are
            often used to facilitate iterative development, continuous
            improvement, and adaptability to changing requirements.
